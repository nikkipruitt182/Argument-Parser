# Argument-Parser

## Introduction

This project was a group term project for my Software Engineering I course. The goal was to create a command line argument parser using test-driven development and the agile methodolgy, Scrum. Over the course of 5 2-week sprints, we attended 4 meetings a week, each consisting of a 15 minute Scrum and an hour of working on the code in groups and individually.  

### Tools Used

* Git - Git was used for source control.
  * Github - Github was used as a host for our source control repository.
* Gradel - 
* Robot Framework -
* Trello - Trello was used to organize our product backlog and create the sprint backlog.


## Classes

* Argument -
* Command Line Argument -
* Optional Argument -
* XML Parser - 
* Argument Parser - 
* There were also a few exception classes.

## Samples 

### Unit Tests

We created unit tests for 4 of our 5 classes (not including exception classes), with the final number of unit tests being 67. By the end of the project, we had 94% of the code coverage, or 94% of the code being tested by unit tests.

At the end of the project, all of the tests we had written were passing. Below is an overview of all the test classes, as well as an overview of the tests from the ArgumentTest class, which tested the basic functions of an argument.

### Acceptance Tests

We created 8 acceptance tests to ensure that our program performed the correct function.

### Documentation

We also created documentation for our project using Javadoc. All classes, including expections, are covered in the documentation, as well as the enumeration we created for the argument data type.
