# Argument-Parser

## Introduction
This project was a group term project for my Software Engineering I course. The goal was to create a command line argument parser using test-driven development. 

## Classes

* Argument -
* Command Line Argument -
* Optional Argument -
* XML Parser - 
* Argument Parser - 
* There were also a few exception classes.

## Samples 

### Unit Tests
We created unit tests for 4 of our 5 classes (not including exception classes). By the end of the project, we had 94% of the code coverage, or 94% of the code being tested by unit tests.

At the end of the project, all of the tests we had written were passing. Below is an overview of all the test classes, as well as an overview of the tests from the ArgumentTest class, which tested the basic functions of an argument.
